# asimo, the dad who likes to tell jokes:

asimo is a chat bot who loves a good joke. You can ask him to tell a joke, or he'll just randomly tell you a joke or pun if he hears you say the right words.

### Running asimo Locally

You can start asimo locally by running:

    % HUBOT_SLACK_TOKEN=[your-slack-token] ./bin/hubot --adapter slack

You can interact with asimo, the dad by:

    typing "dad joke", "dadjoke", or any sentence containing either of these.
    typing "pun," or any statement containing the word pun. (Dad likes to surprise people.)
    like any good dad, if asimo hears the word "dad" in your conversation, he'll quickly jump in ask if you want to hear a good joke.

    thanks, dad!
